# Dementia-prediction-using-OASIS-dataset

## Abstract
Dementia is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory, thinking,
 and behavior, posing a growing burden on aging populations worldwide. There
 is no cure; we can only slow down the progression of the disease. This study exam
ines gender-based differences in feature importance for predicting dementia using
 two datasets: the OASIS-1 and a publicly available Kaggle dementia prediction
 dataset. Each dataset was split on the basis of gender and was analysed separately
 using the Random Forest, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression models. The result
 indicated only a slight difference in feature importance between male and female
 sets. Notably, socioeconomic status was seen as a more significant predictor for
 males than females in the OASIS dataset, while the Kaggle dataset showed mini
mal gender related differences. These findings suggest that the minimal differences
 in feature importance across genders may be attributed to the limited and shared
 set of features used in the datasets, which did not include gender-specific factors
 such as hormonal or biological variables
